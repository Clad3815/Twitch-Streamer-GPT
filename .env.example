# OpenAI Model Configuration

# OPENAI_MODEL: Specifies the OpenAI model to use. By default, it's set to gpt-4.
# Options include:
# - "gpt-4": Offers advanced capabilities but is more expensive.
# - "gpt-4-32k": Provides more context from previous messages but is 10x as expensive as gpt-4.
# - "gpt-3.5-turbo": A less expensive option with good performance.
# - "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k": Provides more context from previous messages but is twice as expensive as gpt-3.5-turbo.
# Note: Switching to "gpt-3.5-turbo" or "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k" can help reduce costs.
OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-3.5-turbo"

# AUTO_USE_SMALL_MODEL: Enables automatic switching to a smaller model when possible.
# - If set to 1 and OPENAI_MODEL is "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k", the system will automatically switch to "gpt-3.5-turbo" if the token count is less than 4096.
# - If set to 1 and OPENAI_MODEL is "gpt-4-32k", the system will automatically switch to "gpt-4" if the token count is less than 8192.
# This setting allows for cost optimization based on the content size.
# Set to 1 to enable, or 0 to disable.
AUTO_USE_SMALL_MODEL=1


# OpenAI Completion Configuration

# This value will be sent inside the prompt of GPT to indicate that the AI should not generate text larger than this value.
# The AI will mostly never respect this value as it's not suited for mathematical operations but it's will help to have shorter answers.
# Delete history.json after changing this value to apply the change otherwise the AI will use it's last messages length as a reference.
OPENAI_MAX_CARACTERS_INSTRUCTIONS=100


# Maximum number of tokens to send to the API.

# The higher the value, the more random the answer will be.
# A value too high can result in incoherent answers.
OPENAI_MODEL_TEMP=0.8

# Frequency penalty of the model (0-1)
# This parameter is used to discourage the model from repeating the same words or phrases too frequently within the generated text. 
# It is a value that is added to the log-probability of a token each time it occurs in the generated text. 
# A higher frequency_penalty value will result in the model being more conservative in its use of repeated tokens.
OPENAI_MODEL_FREQ_PENALTY=1

# Presence penalty of the model (0-1)
# This parameter is used to encourage the model to include a diverse range of tokens in the generated text. 
# It is a value that is subtracted from the log-probability of a token each time it is generated. 
# A higher presence_penalty value will result in the model being more likely to generate tokens that have not yet been included in the generated text.
